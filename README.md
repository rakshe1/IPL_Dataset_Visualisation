# IPL_Dataset_Visualisation

Problem statement to build an interactive Tableau dashboard for a newsletter on IPL, and it includes infographics and derived statistics from the dashboard. This is groundwork for understanding the two pivotal datasets that form the backbone of our analysis:
matches.csv: This dataset provides detailed match-level data across IPL seasons from 2008 to 2017, offering a historical view of the games.
deliveries.csv: This dataset contains ball-by-ball information on each match from 2008 to 2017.
